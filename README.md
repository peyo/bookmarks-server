# Bookmarks Server

This is a server for bookmarks app.

This exercise helps to understand modules (/src/bookmark/bookmark-router) and layers (/src/logger).

Update 4/9/20:
- I've included Express and XSS to the bookmark-router.js file.
- Also started exploring testing endpoints in the ./test folder using Knex and Supertest.
